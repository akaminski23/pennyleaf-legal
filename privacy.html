    Your data stays on your device. We never see your finances.
  </div>

  <h2>1. Data Minimization</h2>
  <p>Your privacy is our priority. PennyLeaf does not sell, rent, or share your personal financial data with third parties for marketing purposes. We collect the minimum amount of information necessary to provide you with a premium budget-tracking experience.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>Your financial data — including transactions, budgets, and categories — is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to your specific transaction history, account balances, or spending patterns. Your finances remain private by design.</p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use RevenueCat to manage subscriptions. This service handles your purchase status but does not see your private financial data. RevenueCat's privacy policy applies to subscription-related data only.</p>

  <h2>4. Analytics</h2>
  <p>We may collect anonymous, aggregated telemetry to improve app performance and stability. No personally identifiable financial information is included in these reports. You cannot be identified from this data.</p>

  <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>PennyLeaf is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us with data, please contact us to have it removed.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can delete all your data at any time by removing the application or using the "Reset Data" option in Settings. If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, including the right to know what data we collect and the right to request deletion.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes through the app. Continued use of PennyLeaf after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
